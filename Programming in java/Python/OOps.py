Python Object Oriented Programming
In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and its fundamental concept with the help of examples.

Video: Object-oriented Programming in Python

Object Oriented Programming
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.

One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:

attributes
behavior
Let's take an example:

A parrot is an object, as it has the following properties:

name, age, color as attributes
singing, dancing as behavior
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:

Class
A class is a blueprint for the object.

We can think of class as a sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object.

The example for class of parrot can be :

class Parrot:
    pass
Here, we use the class keyword to define an empty class Parrot. From class, we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.

Object
An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.

The example for object of parrot class can be:

obj = Parrot()
Here, obj is an object of class Parrot.

Suppose we have details of parrots. Now, we are going to show how to build the class and objects of parrots.

Example 1: Creating Class and Object in Python
class Parrot:

    # class attribute
    species = "bird"

    # instance attribute
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# instantiate the Parrot class
blu = Parrot("Blu", 10)
woo = Parrot("Woo", 15)

# access the class attributes
print("Blu is a {}".format(blu.__class__.species))
print("Woo is also a {}".format(woo.__class__.species))

# access the instance attributes
print("{} is {} years old".format( blu.name, blu.age))
print("{} is {} years old".format( woo.name, woo.age))
Run Code
Output

Blu is a bird
Woo is also a bird
Blu is 10 years old
Woo is 15 years old
In the above program, we created a class with the name Parrot. Then, we define attributes. The attributes are a characteristic of an object.

These attributes are defined inside the __init__ method of the class. It is the initializer method that is first run as soon as the object is created.

Then, we create instances of the Parrot class. Here, blu and woo are references (value) to our new objects.

We can access the class attribute using __class__.species. Class attributes are the same for all instances of a class. Similarly, we access the instance attributes using blu.name and blu.age. However, instance attributes are different for every instance of a class.

Methods
Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object.

Example 2 : Creating Methods in Python
class Parrot:
    
    # instance attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # instance method
    def sing(self, song):
        return "{} sings {}".format(self.name, song)

    def dance(self):
        return "{} is now dancing".format(self.name)

# instantiate the object
blu = Parrot("Blu", 10)

# call our instance methods
print(blu.sing("'Happy'"))
print(blu.dance())
Run Code
Output

Blu sings 'Happy'
Blu is now dancing
In the above program, we define two methods i.e sing() and dance(). These are called instance methods because they are called on an instance object i.e blu.

Inheritance
Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).

Example 3: Use of Inheritance in Python
# parent class
class Bird:
    
    def __init__(self):
        print("Bird is ready")

    def whoisThis(self):
        print("Bird")

    def swim(self):
        print("Swim faster")

# child class
class Penguin(Bird):

    def __init__(self):
        # call super() function
        super().__init__()
        print("Penguin is ready")

    def whoisThis(self):
        print("Penguin")

    def run(self):
        print("Run faster")

peggy = Penguin()
peggy.whoisThis()
peggy.swim()
peggy.run()
Run Code
Output

Bird is ready
Penguin is ready
Penguin
Swim faster
Run faster
In the above program, we created two classes i.e. Bird (parent class) and Penguin (child class). The child class inherits the functions of parent class. We can see this from the swim() method.

Again, the child class modified the behavior of the parent class. We can see this from the whoisThis() method. Furthermore, we extend the functions of the parent class, by creating a new run() method.

Additionally, we use the super() function inside the __init__() method. This allows us to run the __init__() method of the parent class inside the child class.

Encapsulation
Using OOP in Python, we can restrict access to methods and variables. This prevents data from direct modification which is called encapsulation. In Python, we denote private attributes using underscore as the prefix i.e single _ or double __.

Example 4: Data Encapsulation in Python
class Computer:

    def __init__(self):
        self.__maxprice = 900

    def sell(self):
        print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice))

    def setMaxPrice(self, price):
        self.__maxprice = price

c = Computer()
c.sell()

# change the price
c.__maxprice = 1000
c.sell()

# using setter function
c.setMaxPrice(1000)
c.sell()
Run Code
Output

Selling Price: 900
Selling Price: 900
Selling Price: 1000
In the above program, we defined a Computer class.

We used __init__() method to store the maximum selling price of Computer. Here, notice the code

c.__maxprice = 1000
Here, we have tried to modify the value of __maxprice outside of the class. However, since __maxprice is a private variable, this modification is not seen on the output.

As shown, to change the value, we have to use a setter function i.e setMaxPrice() which takes price as a parameter.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).

Suppose, we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape options (rectangle, square, circle). However we could use the same method to color any shape. This concept is called Polymorphism.

Example 5: Using Polymorphism in Python
class Parrot:

    def fly(self):
        print("Parrot can fly")
    
    def swim(self):
        print("Parrot can't swim")

class Penguin:

    def fly(self):
        print("Penguin can't fly")
    
    def swim(self):
        print("Penguin can swim")

# common interface
def flying_test(bird):
    bird.fly()

#instantiate objects
blu = Parrot()
peggy = Penguin()

# passing the object
flying_test(blu)
flying_test(peggy)
Run Code
Output

Parrot can fly
Penguin can't fly
In the above program, we defined two classes Parrot and Penguin. Each of them have a common fly() method. However, their functions are different.

To use polymorphism, we created a common interface i.e flying_test() function that takes any object and calls the object's fly() method. Thus, when we passed the blu and peggy objects in the flying_test() function, it ran effectively.

Key Points to Remember:
Object-Oriented Programming makes the program easy to understand as well as efficient.
Since the class is sharable, the code can be reused.
Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.
Polymorphism allows the same interface for different objects, so programmers can write efficient code.












Python Objects and Classes
In this tutorial, you will learn about the core functionality of Python objects and classes. You'll learn what a class is, how to create it and use it in your program.

Video: Python Classes and Objects

Python Objects and Classes
Python is an object-oriented programming language. Unlike procedure-oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object-oriented programming stresses on objects.

An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.

We can think of a class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

As many houses can be made from a house's blueprint, we can create many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is called instantiation.

Defining a Class in Python
Like function definitions begin with the def keyword in Python, class definitions begin with a class keyword.

The first string inside the class is called docstring and has a brief description of the class. Although not mandatory, this is highly recommended.

Here is a simple class definition.

class MyNewClass:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    pass
A class creates a new local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions.

There are also special attributes in it that begins with double underscores __. For example, __doc__ gives us the docstring of that class.

As soon as we define a class, a new class object is created with the same name. This class object allows us to access the different attributes as well as to instantiate new objects of that class.

class Person:
    "This is a person class"
    age = 10

    def greet(self):
        print('Hello')


# Output: 10
print(Person.age)

# Output: <function Person.greet>
print(Person.greet)

# Output: "This is a person class"
print(Person.__doc__)
Run Code
Output

10
<function Person.greet at 0x7fc78c6e8160>
This is a person class
Creating an Object in Python
We saw that the class object could be used to access different attributes.

It can also be used to create new object instances (instantiation) of that class. The procedure to create an object is similar to a function call.

>>> harry = Person()
This will create a new object instance named harry. We can access the attributes of objects using the object name prefix.

Attributes may be data or method. Methods of an object are corresponding functions of that class.

This means to say, since Person.greet is a function object (attribute of class), Person.greet will be a method object.

class Person:
    "This is a person class"
    age = 10

    def greet(self):
        print('Hello')


# create a new object of Person class
harry = Person()

# Output: <function Person.greet>
print(Person.greet)

# Output: <bound method Person.greet of <__main__.Person object>>
print(harry.greet)

# Calling object's greet() method
# Output: Hello
harry.greet()
Run Code
Output

<function Person.greet at 0x7fd288e4e160>
<bound method Person.greet of <__main__.Person object at 0x7fd288e9fa30>>
Hello
You may have noticed the self parameter in function definition inside the class but we called the method simply as harry.greet() without any arguments. It still worked.

This is because, whenever an object calls its method, the object itself is passed as the first argument. So, harry.greet() translates into Person.greet(harry).

In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method's object before the first argument.

For these reasons, the first argument of the function in class must be the object itself. This is conventionally called self. It can be named otherwise but we highly recommend to follow the convention.

Now you must be familiar with class object, instance object, function object, method object and their differences.

Constructors in Python
Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions as they have special meaning.

Of one particular interest is the __init__() function. This special function gets called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.

This type of function is also called constructors in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). We normally use it to initialize all the variables.

class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self, r=0, i=0):
        self.real = r
        self.imag = i

    def get_data(self):
        print(f'{self.real}+{self.imag}j')


# Create a new ComplexNumber object
num1 = ComplexNumber(2, 3)

# Call get_data() method
# Output: 2+3j
num1.get_data()

# Create another ComplexNumber object
# and create a new attribute 'attr'
num2 = ComplexNumber(5)
num2.attr = 10

# Output: (5, 0, 10)
print((num2.real, num2.imag, num2.attr))

# but c1 object doesn't have attribute 'attr'
# AttributeError: 'ComplexNumber' object has no attribute 'attr'
print(num1.attr)
Run Code
Output

2+3j
(5, 0, 10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 27, in <module>
    print(num1.attr)
AttributeError: 'ComplexNumber' object has no attribute 'attr'
In the above example, we defined a new class to represent complex numbers. It has two functions, __init__() to initialize the variables (defaults to zero) and get_data() to display the number properly.

An interesting thing to note in the above step is that attributes of an object can be created on the fly. We created a new attribute attr for object num2 and read it as well. But this does not create that attribute for object num1.

Deleting Attributes and Objects
Any attribute of an object can be deleted anytime, using the del statement. Try the following on the Python shell to see the output.

>>> num1 = ComplexNumber(2,3)
>>> del num1.imag
>>> num1.get_data()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'ComplexNumber' object has no attribute 'imag'

>>> del ComplexNumber.get_data
>>> num1.get_data()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'ComplexNumber' object has no attribute 'get_data'
We can even delete the object itself, using the del statement.

>>> c1 = ComplexNumber(1,3)
>>> del c1
>>> c1
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'c1' is not defined
Actually, it is more complicated than that. When we do c1 = ComplexNumber(1,3), a new instance object is created in memory and the name c1 binds with it.

On the command del c1, this binding is removed and the name c1 is deleted from the corresponding namespace. The object however continues to exist in memory and if no other name is bound to it, it is later automatically destroyed.

This automatic destruction of unreferenced objects in Python is also called garbage collection.

Deleting Object in Python
Deleting objects in Python removes the name binding
















Python Inheritance
Inheritance enables us to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows us to add more. In this tutorial, you will learn to use inheritance in Python.

Video: Python Inheritance

Inheritance in Python
Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming.

It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.

Python Inheritance Syntax
class BaseClass:
  Body of base class
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
  Body of derived class
Derived class inherits features from the base class where new features can be added to it. This results in re-usability of code.

Example of Inheritance in Python
To demonstrate the use of inheritance, let us take an example.

A polygon is a closed figure with 3 or more sides. Say, we have a class called Polygon defined as follows.

class Polygon:
    def __init__(self, no_of_sides):
        self.n = no_of_sides
        self.sides = [0 for i in range(no_of_sides)]

    def inputSides(self):
        self.sides = [float(input("Enter side "+str(i+1)+" : ")) for i in range(self.n)]

    def dispSides(self):
        for i in range(self.n):
            print("Side",i+1,"is",self.sides[i])
This class has data attributes to store the number of sides n and magnitude of each side as a list called sides.

The inputSides() method takes in the magnitude of each side and dispSides() displays these side lengths.

A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides. So, we can create a class called Triangle which inherits from Polygon. This makes all the attributes of Polygon class available to the Triangle class.

We don't need to define them again (code reusability). Triangle can be defined as follows.

class Triangle(Polygon):
    def __init__(self):
        Polygon.__init__(self,3)

    def findArea(self):
        a, b, c = self.sides
        # calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
        print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
However, class Triangle has a new method findArea() to find and print the area of the triangle. Here is a sample run.

>>> t = Triangle()

>>> t.inputSides()
Enter side 1 : 3
Enter side 2 : 5
Enter side 3 : 4

>>> t.dispSides()
Side 1 is 3.0
Side 2 is 5.0
Side 3 is 4.0

>>> t.findArea()
The area of the triangle is 6.00
We can see that even though we did not define methods like inputSides() or dispSides() for class Triangle separately, we were able to use them.

If an attribute is not found in the class itself, the search continues to the base class. This repeats recursively, if the base class is itself derived from other classes.

Method Overriding in Python
In the above example, notice that __init__() method was defined in both classes, Triangle as well Polygon. When this happens, the method in the derived class overrides that in the base class. This is to say, __init__() in Triangle gets preference over the __init__ in Polygon.

Generally when overriding a base method, we tend to extend the definition rather than simply replace it. The same is being done by calling the method in base class from the one in derived class (calling Polygon.__init__() from __init__() in Triangle).

A better option would be to use the built-in function super(). So, super().__init__(3) is equivalent to Polygon.__init__(self,3) and is preferred. To learn more about the super() function in Python, visit Python super() function.

Two built-in functions isinstance() and issubclass() are used to check inheritances.

The function isinstance() returns True if the object is an instance of the class or other classes derived from it. Each and every class in Python inherits from the base class object.

>>> isinstance(t,Triangle)
True

>>> isinstance(t,Polygon)
True

>>> isinstance(t,int)
False

>>> isinstance(t,object)
True
Similarly, issubclass() is used to check for class inheritance.

>>> issubclass(Polygon,Triangle)
False

>>> issubclass(Triangle,Polygon)
True

>>> issubclass(bool,int)
True





















Python Multiple Inheritance
In this tutorial, you'll learn about multiple inheritance in Python and how to use it in your program. You'll also learn about multi-level inheritance and the method resolution order.

Python Multiple Inheritance
A class can be derived from more than one base class in Python, similar to C++. This is called multiple inheritance.

In multiple inheritance, the features of all the base classes are inherited into the derived class. The syntax for multiple inheritance is similar to single inheritance.

Example
class Base1:
    pass

class Base2:
    pass

class MultiDerived(Base1, Base2):
    pass
Here, the MultiDerived class is derived from Base1 and Base2 classes.

Multiple Inheritance in Python
Multiple Inheritance in Python
The MultiDerived class inherits from both Base1 and Base2 classes.

Python Multilevel Inheritance
We can also inherit from a derived class. This is called multilevel inheritance. It can be of any depth in Python.

In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are inherited into the new derived class.

An example with corresponding visualization is given below.

class Base:
    pass

class Derived1(Base):
    pass

class Derived2(Derived1):
    pass
Here, the Derived1 class is derived from the Base class, and the Derived2 class is derived from the Derived1 class.

Multilevel Inheritance in Python
Multilevel Inheritance in Python
Method Resolution Order in Python
Every class in Python is derived from the object class. It is the most base type in Python.

So technically, all other classes, either built-in or user-defined, are derived classes and all objects are instances of the object class.

# Output: True
print(issubclass(list,object))

# Output: True
print(isinstance(5.5,object))

# Output: True
print(isinstance("Hello",object))
Run Code
In the multiple inheritance scenario, any specified attribute is searched first in the current class. If not found, the search continues into parent classes in depth-first, left-right fashion without searching the same class twice.

So, in the above example of MultiDerived class the search order is [MultiDerived, Base1, Base2, object]. This order is also called linearization of MultiDerived class and the set of rules used to find this order is called Method Resolution Order (MRO).

MRO must prevent local precedence ordering and also provide monotonicity. It ensures that a class always appears before its parents. In case of multiple parents, the order is the same as tuples of base classes.

MRO of a class can be viewed as the __mro__ attribute or the mro() method. The former returns a tuple while the latter returns a list.

>>> MultiDerived.__mro__
(<class '__main__.MultiDerived'>,
 <class '__main__.Base1'>,
 <class '__main__.Base2'>,
 <class 'object'>)

>>> MultiDerived.mro()
[<class '__main__.MultiDerived'>,
 <class '__main__.Base1'>,
 <class '__main__.Base2'>,
 <class 'object'>]
Here is a little more complex multiple inheritance example and its visualization along with the MRO.

Output

[<class '__main__.M'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.X'>, <class '__main__.Y'>, <class '__main__.Z'>, <class 'object'>]

Python Operator Overloading
You can change the meaning of an operator in Python depending upon the operands used. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use operator overloading in Python Object Oriented Programming.

Python Operator Overloading
Python operators work for built-in classes. But the same operator behaves differently with different types. For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.

This feature in Python that allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading.

So what happens when we use them with objects of a user-defined class? Let us consider the following class, which tries to simulate a point in 2-D coordinate system.

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y


p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(2, 3)
print(p1+p2)
Run Code
Output

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 9, in <module>
    print(p1+p2)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'
Here, we can see that a TypeError was raised, since Python didn't know how to add two Point objects together.

However, we can achieve this task in Python through operator overloading. But first, let's get a notion about special functions.

Python Special Functions
Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions in Python.

These functions are not the typical functions that we define for a class. The __init__() function we defined above is one of them. It gets called every time we create a new object of that class.

There are numerous other special functions in Python. Visit Python Special Functions to learn more about them.

Using special functions, we can make our class compatible with built-in functions.

>>> p1 = Point(2,3)
>>> print(p1)
<__main__.Point object at 0x00000000031F8CC0>
Suppose we want the print() function to print the coordinates of the Point object instead of what we got. We can define a __str__() method in our class that controls how the object gets printed. Let's look at how we can achieve this:

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x,self.y)
Now let's try the print() function again.

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "({0}, {1})".format(self.x, self.y)


p1 = Point(2, 3)
print(p1)
Run Code
Output

(2, 3)
That's better. Turns out, that this same method is invoked when we use the built-in function str() or format().

>>> str(p1)
'(2,3)'

>>> format(p1)
'(2,3)'
So, when you use str(p1) or format(p1), Python internally calls the p1.__str__() method. Hence the name, special functions.

Now let's go back to operator overloading.

Overloading the + Operator
To overload the + operator, we will need to implement __add__() function in the class. With great power comes great responsibility. We can do whatever we like, inside this function. But it is more sensible to return a Point object of the coordinate sum.

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x, self.y)

    def __add__(self, other):
        x = self.x + other.x
        y = self.y + other.y
        return Point(x, y)
Now let's try the addition operation again:

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x, self.y)

    def __add__(self, other):
        x = self.x + other.x
        y = self.y + other.y
        return Point(x, y)


p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(2, 3)

print(p1+p2)
Run Code
Output

(3,5)
What actually happens is that, when you use p1 + p2, Python calls p1.__add__(p2) which in turn is Point.__add__(p1,p2). After this, the addition operation is carried out the way we specified.

Similarly, we can overload other operators as well. The special function that we need to implement is tabulated below.

Operator	Expression	Internally
Addition	p1 + p2	p1.__add__(p2)
Subtraction	p1 - p2	p1.__sub__(p2)
Multiplication	p1 * p2	p1.__mul__(p2)
Power	p1 ** p2	p1.__pow__(p2)
Division	p1 / p2	p1.__truediv__(p2)
Floor Division	p1 // p2	p1.__floordiv__(p2)
Remainder (modulo)	p1 % p2	p1.__mod__(p2)
Bitwise Left Shift	p1 << p2	p1.__lshift__(p2)
Bitwise Right Shift	p1 >> p2	p1.__rshift__(p2)
Bitwise AND	p1 & p2	p1.__and__(p2)
Bitwise OR	p1 | p2	p1.__or__(p2)
Bitwise XOR	p1 ^ p2	p1.__xor__(p2)
Bitwise NOT	~p1	p1.__invert__()
Overloading Comparison Operators
Python does not limit operator overloading to arithmetic operators only. We can overload comparison operators as well.

Suppose we wanted to implement the less than symbol < symbol in our Point class.

Let us compare the magnitude of these points from the origin and return the result for this purpose. It can be implemented as follows.

# overloading the less than operator
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "({0},{1})".format(self.x, self.y)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        self_mag = (self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)
        other_mag = (other.x ** 2) + (other.y ** 2)
        return self_mag < other_mag

p1 = Point(1,1)
p2 = Point(-2,-3)
p3 = Point(1,-1)

# use less than
print(p1<p2)
print(p2<p3)
print(p1<p3)
Run Code
Output

True
False
False
Similarly, the special functions that we need to implement, to overload other comparison operators are tabulated below.

Operator	Expression	Internally
Less than	p1 < p2	p1.__lt__(p2)
Less than or equal to	p1 <= p2	p1.__le__(p2)
Equal to	p1 == p2	p1.__eq__(p2)
Not equal to	p1 != p2	p1.__ne__(p2)
Greater than	p1 > p2	p1.__gt__(p2)
Greater than or equal to	p1 >= p2	p1.__ge__(p2)


















Python Iterators
Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon. In this tutorial, you will learn how iterator works and how you can build your own iterator using __iter__ and __next__ methods.

Video: Python Iterators

Iterators in Python
Iterators are everywhere in Python. They are elegantly implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators etc. but are hidden in plain sight.

Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.

Technically speaking, a Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocol.

An object is called iterable if we can get an iterator from it. Most built-in containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables.

The iter() function (which in turn calls the __iter__() method) returns an iterator from them.

Iterating Through an Iterator
We use the next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator. When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, it will raise the StopIteration Exception. Following is an example.

# define a list
my_list = [4, 7, 0, 3]

# get an iterator using iter()
my_iter = iter(my_list)

# iterate through it using next()

# Output: 4
print(next(my_iter))

# Output: 7
print(next(my_iter))

# next(obj) is same as obj.__next__()

# Output: 0
print(my_iter.__next__())

# Output: 3
print(my_iter.__next__())

# This will raise error, no items left
next(my_iter)
Run Code
Output

4
7
0
3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 24, in <module>
    next(my_iter)
StopIteration
A more elegant way of automatically iterating is by using the for loop. Using this, we can iterate over any object that can return an iterator, for example list, string, file etc.

>>> for element in my_list:
...     print(element)
...     
4
7
0
3
Working of for loop for Iterators
As we see in the above example, the for loop was able to iterate automatically through the list.

In fact the for loop can iterate over any iterable. Let's take a closer look at how the for loop is actually implemented in Python.

for element in iterable:
    # do something with element
Is actually implemented as.

# create an iterator object from that iterable
iter_obj = iter(iterable)

# infinite loop
while True:
    try:
        # get the next item
        element = next(iter_obj)
        # do something with element
    except StopIteration:
        # if StopIteration is raised, break from loop
        break
So internally, the for loop creates an iterator object, iter_obj by calling iter() on the iterable.

Ironically, this for loop is actually an infinite while loop.

Inside the loop, it calls next() to get the next element and executes the body of the for loop with this value. After all the items exhaust, StopIteration is raised which is internally caught and the loop ends. Note that any other kind of exception will pass through.

Building Custom Iterators
Building an iterator from scratch is easy in Python. We just have to implement the __iter__() and the __next__() methods.

The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be performed.

The __next__() method must return the next item in the sequence. On reaching the end, and in subsequent calls, it must raise StopIteration.

Here, we show an example that will give us the next power of 2 in each iteration. Power exponent starts from zero up to a user set number.

If you do not have any idea about object-oriented programming, visit Python Object-Oriented Programming.

class PowTwo:
    """Class to implement an iterator
    of powers of two"""

    def __init__(self, max=0):
        self.max = max

    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = 0
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.n <= self.max:
            result = 2 ** self.n
            self.n += 1
            return result
        else:
            raise StopIteration


# create an object
numbers = PowTwo(3)

# create an iterable from the object
i = iter(numbers)

# Using next to get to the next iterator element
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
Run Code
Output

1

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/bsoyuj/Desktop/Untitled-1.py", line 32, in <module>
    print(next(i))
  File "<string>", line 18, in __next__
    raise StopIteration
StopIteration
We can also use a for loop to iterate over our iterator class.

>>> for i in PowTwo(5):
...     print(i)
...

Python Infinite Iterators
It is not necessary that the item in an iterator object has to be exhausted. There can be infinite iterators (which never ends). We must be careful when handling such iterators.

Here is a simple example to demonstrate infinite iterators.

The built-in function iter() can be called with two arguments where the first argument must be a callable object (function) and second is the sentinel. The iterator calls this function until the returned value is equal to the sentinel.

>>> int()
0

>>> inf = iter(int,1)
>>> next(inf)
0
>>> next(inf)
0
We can see that the int() function always returns 0. So passing it as iter(int,1) will return an iterator that calls int() until the returned value equals 1. This never happens and we get an infinite iterator.

We can also build our own infinite iterators. The following iterator will, theoretically, return all the odd numbers.

class InfIter:
    """Infinite iterator to return all
        odd numbers"""

    def __iter__(self):
        self.num = 1
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        num = self.num
        self.num += 2
        return num
Run Code
A sample run would be as follows.

>>> a = iter(InfIter())
>>> next(a)
1
>>> next(a)
3
>>> next(a)
5
>>> next(a)
7
And so on...

Be careful to include a terminating condition, when iterating over these types of infinite iterators.

The advantage of using iterators is that they save resources. Like shown above, we could get all the odd numbers without storing the entire number system in memory. We can have infinite items (theoretically) in finite memory.

There's an easier way to create iterators in Python. To learn more visit: Python generators using yield.'














Python Generators
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create iterations easily using Python generators, how it is different from iterators and normal functions, and why you should use it.

Video: Python Generators

Generators in Python
There is a lot of work in building an iterator in Python. We have to implement a class with __iter__() and __next__() method, keep track of internal states, and raise StopIteration when there are no values to be returned.

This is both lengthy and counterintuitive. Generator comes to the rescue in such situations.

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.

Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).

Create Generators in Python
It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function, but with a yield statement instead of a return statement.

If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.

The difference is that while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.

Differences between Generator function and Normal function
Here is how a generator function differs from a normal function.

Generator function contains one or more yield statements.
When called, it returns an object (iterator) but does not start execution immediately.
Methods like __iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. So we can iterate through the items using next().
Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.
Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.
Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.
Here is an example to illustrate all of the points stated above. We have a generator function named my_gen() with several yield statements.

# A simple generator function
def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    # Generator function contains yield statements
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n
An interactive run in the interpreter is given below. Run these in the Python shell to see the output.

>>> # It returns an object but does not start execution immediately.
>>> a = my_gen()

>>> # We can iterate through the items using next().
>>> next(a)
This is printed first
1
>>> # Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.

>>> # Local variables and theirs states are remembered between successive calls.
>>> next(a)
This is printed second
2

>>> next(a)
This is printed at last
3

>>> # Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.
>>> next(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
StopIteration
>>> next(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
StopIteration
One interesting thing to note in the above example is that the value of variable n is remembered between each call.

Unlike normal functions, the local variables are not destroyed when the function yields. Furthermore, the generator object can be iterated only once.

To restart the process we need to create another generator object using something like a = my_gen().

One final thing to note is that we can use generators with for loops directly.

This is because a for loop takes an iterator and iterates over it using next() function. It automatically ends when StopIteration is raised. Check here to know how a for loop is actually implemented in Python.

# A simple generator function
def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    # Generator function contains yield statements
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n


# Using for loop
for item in my_gen():
    print(item)
Run Code
When you run the program, the output will be:

This is printed first
1
This is printed second
2
This is printed at last
3
Python Generators with a Loop
The above example is of less use and we studied it just to get an idea of what was happening in the background.

Normally, generator functions are implemented with a loop having a suitable terminating condition.

Let's take an example of a generator that reverses a string.

def rev_str(my_str):
    length = len(my_str)
    for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
        yield my_str[i]


# For loop to reverse the string
for char in rev_str("hello"):
    print(char)
Run Code
Output

o
l
l
e
h
In this example, we have used the range() function to get the index in reverse order using the for loop.

Note: This generator function not only works with strings, but also with other kinds of iterables like list, tuple, etc.

Python Generator Expression
Simple generators can be easily created on the fly using generator expressions. It makes building generators easy.

Similar to the lambda functions which create anonymous functions, generator expressions create anonymous generator functions.

The syntax for generator expression is similar to that of a list comprehension in Python. But the square brackets are replaced with round parentheses.

The major difference between a list comprehension and a generator expression is that a list comprehension produces the entire list while the generator expression produces one item at a time.

They have lazy execution ( producing items only when asked for ). For this reason, a generator expression is much more memory efficient than an equivalent list comprehension.

# Initialize the list
my_list = [1, 3, 6, 10]

# square each term using list comprehension
list_ = [x**2 for x in my_list]

# same thing can be done using a generator expression
# generator expressions are surrounded by parenthesis ()
generator = (x**2 for x in my_list)

print(list_)
print(generator)
Run Code
Output

[1, 9, 36, 100]
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x7f5d4eb4bf50>
We can see above that the generator expression did not produce the required result immediately. Instead, it returned a generator object, which produces items only on demand.

Here is how we can start getting items from the generator:

# Initialize the list
my_list = [1, 3, 6, 10]

a = (x**2 for x in my_list)
print(next(a))

print(next(a))

print(next(a))

print(next(a))

next(a)
Run Code
When we run the above program, we get the following output:

1
9
36
100
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 15, in <module>
StopIteration
Generator expressions can be used as function arguments. When used in such a way, the round parentheses can be dropped.

>>> sum(x**2 for x in my_list)
146

>>> max(x**2 for x in my_list)
100
Use of Python Generators
There are several reasons that make generators a powerful implementation.

1. Easy to Implement
Generators can be implemented in a clear and concise way as compared to their iterator class counterpart. Following is an example to implement a sequence of power of 2 using an iterator class.

class PowTwo:
    def __init__(self, max=0):
        self.n = 0
        self.max = max

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.n > self.max:
            raise StopIteration

        result = 2 ** self.n
        self.n += 1
        return result
The above program was lengthy and confusing. Now, let's do the same using a generator function.

def PowTwoGen(max=0):
    n = 0
    while n < max:
        yield 2 ** n
        n += 1
Since generators keep track of details automatically, the implementation was concise and much cleaner.

2. Memory Efficient
A normal function to return a sequence will create the entire sequence in memory before returning the result. This is an overkill, if the number of items in the sequence is very large.

Generator implementation of such sequences is memory friendly and is preferred since it only produces one item at a time.

3. Represent Infinite Stream
Generators are excellent mediums to represent an infinite stream of data. Infinite streams cannot be stored in memory, and since generators produce only one item at a time, they can represent an infinite stream of data.

The following generator function can generate all the even numbers (at least in theory).

def all_even():
    n = 0
    while True:
        yield n
        n += 2
4. Pipelining Generators
Multiple generators can be used to pipeline a series of operations. This is best illustrated using an example.

Suppose we have a generator that produces the numbers in the Fibonacci series. And we have another generator for squaring numbers.

If we want to find out the sum of squares of numbers in the Fibonacci series, we can do it in the following way by pipelining the output of generator functions together.

def fibonacci_numbers(nums):
    x, y = 0, 1
    for _ in range(nums):
        x, y = y, x+y
        yield x

def square(nums):
    for num in nums:
        yield num**2

print(sum(square(fibonacci_numbers(10))))
Run Code
Output

4895
This pipelining is efficient and easy to read (and yes, a lot cooler!).















Python Closures
In this tutorial, you'll learn about Python closure, how to define a closure, and the reasons you should use it.

Nonlocal variable in a nested function
Before getting into what a closure is, we have to first understand what a nested function and nonlocal variable is.

A function defined inside another function is called a nested function. Nested functions can access variables of the enclosing scope.

In Python, these non-local variables are read-only by default and we must declare them explicitly as non-local (using nonlocal keyword) in order to modify them.

Following is an example of a nested function accessing a non-local variable.

def print_msg(msg):
    # This is the outer enclosing function

    def printer():
        # This is the nested function
        print(msg)

    printer()

# We execute the function
# Output: Hello
print_msg("Hello")
Run Code
Output

Hello
We can see that the nested printer() function was able to access the non-local msg variable of the enclosing function.

Defining a Closure Function
In the example above, what would happen if the last line of the function print_msg() returned the printer() function instead of calling it? This means the function was defined as follows:

def print_msg(msg):
    # This is the outer enclosing function

    def printer():
        # This is the nested function
        print(msg)

    return printer  # returns the nested function


# Now let's try calling this function.
# Output: Hello
another = print_msg("Hello")
another()
Run Code
Output

Hello
That's unusual.

The print_msg() function was called with the string "Hello" and the returned function was bound to the name another. On calling another(), the message was still remembered although we had already finished executing the print_msg() function.

This technique by which some data ("Hello in this case) gets attached to the code is called closure in Python.

This value in the enclosing scope is remembered even when the variable goes out of scope or the function itself is removed from the current namespace.

Try running the following in the Python shell to see the output.

>>> del print_msg
>>> another()
Hello
>>> print_msg("Hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'print_msg' is not defined
Here, the returned function still works even when the original function was deleted.

When do we have closures?
As seen from the above example, we have a closure in Python when a nested function references a value in its enclosing scope.

The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are summarized in the following points.

We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
The enclosing function must return the nested function.
When to use closures?
So what are closures good for?

Closures can avoid the use of global values and provides some form of data hiding. It can also provide an object oriented solution to the problem.

When there are few methods (one method in most cases) to be implemented in a class, closures can provide an alternate and more elegant solution. But when the number of attributes and methods get larger, it's better to implement a class.

Here is a simple example where a closure might be more preferable than defining a class and making objects. But the preference is all yours.

def make_multiplier_of(n):
    def multiplier(x):
        return x * n
    return multiplier


# Multiplier of 3
times3 = make_multiplier_of(3)

# Multiplier of 5
times5 = make_multiplier_of(5)

# Output: 27
print(times3(9))

# Output: 15
print(times5(3))

# Output: 30
print(times5(times3(2)))
Run Code
Output

27
15
30
Python Decorators make an extensive use of closures as well.

On a concluding note, it is good to point out that the values that get enclosed in the closure function can be found out.

All function objects have a __closure__ attribute that returns a tuple of cell objects if it is a closure function. Referring to the example above, we know times3 and times5 are closure functions.

>>> make_multiplier_of.__closure__
>>> times3.__closure__
(<cell at 0x0000000002D155B8: int object at 0x000000001E39B6E0>,)
The cell object has the attribute cell_contents which stores the closed value.

>>> times3.__closure__[0].cell_contents
3
>>> times5.__closure__[0].cell_contents
5

















Python Decorators
A decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality and returns it. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can create a decorator and why you should use it.

Video: @Decorators in Python

Decorators in Python
Python has an interesting feature called decorators to add functionality to an existing code.

This is also called metaprogramming because a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time.

Prerequisites for learning decorators
In order to understand about decorators, we must first know a few basic things in Python.

We must be comfortable with the fact that everything in Python (Yes! Even classes), are objects. Names that we define are simply identifiers bound to these objects. Functions are no exceptions, they are objects too (with attributes). Various different names can be bound to the same function object.

Here is an example.

def first(msg):
    print(msg)


first("Hello")

second = first
second("Hello")
Run Code
Output

Hello
Hello
When you run the code, both functions first and second give the same output. Here, the names first and second refer to the same function object.

Now things start getting weirder.

Functions can be passed as arguments to another function.

If you have used functions like map, filter and reduce in Python, then you already know about this.

Such functions that take other functions as arguments are also called higher order functions. Here is an example of such a function.

def inc(x):
    return x + 1


def dec(x):
    return x - 1


def operate(func, x):
    result = func(x)
    return result
Run Code
We invoke the function as follows.

>>> operate(inc,3)
4
>>> operate(dec,3)
2
Furthermore, a function can return another function.

def is_called():
    def is_returned():
        print("Hello")
    return is_returned


new = is_called()

# Outputs "Hello"
new()
Run Code
Output

Hello
Here, is_returned() is a nested function which is defined and returned each time we call is_called().

Finally, we must know about Closures in Python.

Getting back to Decorators
Functions and methods are called callable as they can be called.

In fact, any object which implements the special __call__() method is termed callable. So, in the most basic sense, a decorator is a callable that returns a callable.

Basically, a decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality and returns it.

def make_pretty(func):
    def inner():
        print("I got decorated")
        func()
    return inner


def ordinary():
    print("I am ordinary")
Run Code
When you run the following codes in shell,

>>> ordinary()
I am ordinary

>>> # let's decorate this ordinary function
>>> pretty = make_pretty(ordinary)
>>> pretty()
I got decorated
I am ordinary
In the example shown above, make_pretty() is a decorator. In the assignment step:

pretty = make_pretty(ordinary)
The function ordinary() got decorated and the returned function was given the name pretty.

We can see that the decorator function added some new functionality to the original function. This is similar to packing a gift. The decorator acts as a wrapper. The nature of the object that got decorated (actual gift inside) does not alter. But now, it looks pretty (since it got decorated).

Generally, we decorate a function and reassign it as,

ordinary = make_pretty(ordinary).
This is a common construct and for this reason, Python has a syntax to simplify this.

We can use the @ symbol along with the name of the decorator function and place it above the definition of the function to be decorated. For example,

@make_pretty
def ordinary():
    print("I am ordinary")
is equivalent to

def ordinary():
    print("I am ordinary")
ordinary = make_pretty(ordinary)
This is just a syntactic sugar to implement decorators.

Decorating Functions with Parameters
The above decorator was simple and it only worked with functions that did not have any parameters. What if we had functions that took in parameters like:

def divide(a, b):
    return a/b
This function has two parameters, a and b. We know it will give an error if we pass in b as 0.

>>> divide(2,5)
0.4
>>> divide(2,0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
Now let's make a decorator to check for this case that will cause the error.

def smart_divide(func):
    def inner(a, b):
        print("I am going to divide", a, "and", b)
        if b == 0:
            print("Whoops! cannot divide")
            return

        return func(a, b)
    return inner


@smart_divide
def divide(a, b):
    print(a/b)
Run Code
This new implementation will return None if the error condition arises.

>>> divide(2,5)
I am going to divide 2 and 5
0.4

>>> divide(2,0)
I am going to divide 2 and 0
Whoops! cannot divide
In this manner, we can decorate functions that take parameters.

A keen observer will notice that parameters of the nested inner() function inside the decorator is the same as the parameters of functions it decorates. Taking this into account, now we can make general decorators that work with any number of parameters.

In Python, this magic is done as function(*args, **kwargs). In this way, args will be the tuple of positional arguments and kwargs will be the dictionary of keyword arguments. An example of such a decorator will be:

def works_for_all(func):
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        print("I can decorate any function")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner
Chaining Decorators in Python
Multiple decorators can be chained in Python.

This is to say, a function can be decorated multiple times with different (or same) decorators. We simply place the decorators above the desired function.

def star(func):
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        print("*" * 30)
        func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("*" * 30)
    return inner


def percent(func):
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        print("%" * 30)
        func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("%" * 30)
    return inner


@star
@percent
def printer(msg):
    print(msg)


printer("Hello")
Run Code
Output

******************************
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Hello
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
******************************
The above syntax of,

@star
@percent
def printer(msg):
    print(msg)
is equivalent to

def printer(msg):
    print(msg)
printer = star(percent(printer))
The order in which we chain decorators matter. If we had reversed the order as,

@percent
@star
def printer(msg):
    print(msg)
The output would be:

Python @property decorator
In this tutorial, you will learn about Python @property decorator; a pythonic way to use getters and setters in object-oriented programming.

Python programming provides us with a built-in @property decorator which makes usage of getter and setters much easier in Object-Oriented Programming.

Before going into details on what @property decorator is, let us first build an intuition on why it would be needed in the first place.

Class Without Getters and Setters
Let us assume that we decide to make a class that stores the temperature in degrees Celsius. It would also implement a method to convert the temperature into degrees Fahrenheit. One way of doing this is as follows:

class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature = 0):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32
We can make objects out of this class and manipulate the temperature attribute as we wish:

# Basic method of setting and getting attributes in Python
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32


# Create a new object
human = Celsius()

# Set the temperature
human.temperature = 37

# Get the temperature attribute
print(human.temperature)

# Get the to_fahrenheit method
print(human.to_fahrenheit())
Run Code
Output

37
98.60000000000001
The extra decimal places when converting into Fahrenheit is due to the floating point arithmetic error. To learn more, visit Python Floating Point Arithmetic Error.

Whenever we assign or retrieve any object attribute like temperature as shown above, Python searches it in the object's built-in __dict__ dictionary attribute.

>>> human.__dict__
{'temperature': 37}
Therefore, man.temperature internally becomes man.__dict__['temperature'].

Using Getters and Setters
Suppose we want to extend the usability of the Celsius class defined above. We know that the temperature of any object cannot reach below -273.15 degrees Celsius (Absolute Zero in Thermodynamics)

Let's update our code to implement this value constraint.

An obvious solution to the above restriction will be to hide the attribute temperature (make it private) and define new getter and setter methods to manipulate it. This can be done as follows:

# Making Getters and Setter methods
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.set_temperature(temperature)

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.get_temperature() * 1.8) + 32

    # getter method
    def get_temperature(self):
        return self._temperature

    # setter method
    def set_temperature(self, value):
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273.15 is not possible.")
        self._temperature = value
As we can see, the above method introduces two new get_temperature() and set_temperature() methods.

Furthermore, temperature was replaced with _temperature. An underscore _ at the beginning is used to denote private variables in Python.

Now, let's use this implementation:

# Making Getters and Setter methods
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.set_temperature(temperature)

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.get_temperature() * 1.8) + 32

    # getter method
    def get_temperature(self):
        return self._temperature

    # setter method
    def set_temperature(self, value):
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273.15 is not possible.")
        self._temperature = value


# Create a new object, set_temperature() internally called by __init__
human = Celsius(37)

# Get the temperature attribute via a getter
print(human.get_temperature())

# Get the to_fahrenheit method, get_temperature() called by the method itself
print(human.to_fahrenheit())

# new constraint implementation
human.set_temperature(-300)

# Get the to_fahreheit method
print(human.to_fahrenheit())
Run Code
Output

37
98.60000000000001
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 30, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 16, in set_temperature
ValueError: Temperature below -273.15 is not possible.
This update successfully implemented the new restriction. We are no longer allowed to set the temperature below -273.15 degrees Celsius.

Note: The private variables don't actually exist in Python. There are simply norms to be followed. The language itself doesn't apply any restrictions.

>>> human._temperature = -300
>>> human.get_temperature()
-300
However, the bigger problem with the above update is that all the programs that implemented our previous class have to modify their code from obj.temperature to obj.get_temperature() and all expressions like obj.temperature = val to obj.set_temperature(val).

This refactoring can cause problems while dealing with hundreds of thousands of lines of codes.

All in all, our new update was not backwards compatible. This is where @property comes to rescue.

The property Class
A pythonic way to deal with the above problem is to use the property class. Here is how we can update our code:

# using property class
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32

    # getter
    def get_temperature(self):
        print("Getting value...")
        return self._temperature

    # setter
    def set_temperature(self, value):
        print("Setting value...")
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273.15 is not possible")
        self._temperature = value

    # creating a property object
    temperature = property(get_temperature, set_temperature)
We added a print() function inside get_temperature() and set_temperature() to clearly observe that they are being executed.

The last line of the code makes a property object temperature. Simply put, property attaches some code (get_temperature and set_temperature) to the member attribute accesses (temperature).

Let's use this update code:

# using property class
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32

    # getter
    def get_temperature(self):
        print("Getting value...")
        return self._temperature

    # setter
    def set_temperature(self, value):
        print("Setting value...")
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273.15 is not possible")
        self._temperature = value

    # creating a property object
    temperature = property(get_temperature, set_temperature)


human = Celsius(37)

print(human.temperature)

print(human.to_fahrenheit())

human.temperature = -300
Run Code
Output

Setting value...
Getting value...
37
Getting value...
98.60000000000001
Setting value...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 31, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 18, in set_temperature
ValueError: Temperature below -273 is not possible
As we can see, any code that retrieves the value of temperature will automatically call get_temperature() instead of a dictionary (__dict__) look-up. Similarly, any code that assigns a value to temperature will automatically call set_temperature().

We can even see above that set_temperature() was called even when we created an object.

>>> human = Celsius(37)
Setting value...
Can you guess why?

The reason is that when an object is created, the __init__() method gets called. This method has the line self.temperature = temperature. This expression automatically calls set_temperature().

Similarly, any access like c.temperature automatically calls get_temperature(). This is what property does. Here are a few more examples.

>>> human.temperature
Getting value
37
>>> human.temperature = 37
Setting value

>>> c.to_fahrenheit()
Getting value
98.60000000000001
By using property, we can see that no modification is required in the implementation of the value constraint. Thus, our implementation is backward compatible.

Note: The actual temperature value is stored in the private _temperature variable. The temperature attribute is a property object which provides an interface to this private variable.

The @property Decorator
In Python, property() is a built-in function that creates and returns a property object. The syntax of this function is:

property(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)
where,

fget is function to get value of the attribute
fset is function to set value of the attribute
fdel is function to delete the attribute
doc is a string (like a comment)
As seen from the implementation, these function arguments are optional. So, a property object can simply be created as follows.

>>> property()
<property object at 0x0000000003239B38>
A property object has three methods, getter(), setter(), and deleter() to specify fget, fset and fdel at a later point. This means, the line:

temperature = property(get_temperature,set_temperature)
can be broken down as:

# make empty property
temperature = property()
# assign fget
temperature = temperature.getter(get_temperature)
# assign fset
temperature = temperature.setter(set_temperature)
These two pieces of codes are equivalent.

Programmers familiar with Python Decorators can recognize that the above construct can be implemented as decorators.

We can even not define the names get_temperature and set_temperature as they are unnecessary and pollute the class namespace.

For this, we reuse the temperature name while defining our getter and setter functions. Let's look at how to implement this as a decorator:

# Using @property decorator
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature=0):
        self.temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32

    @property
    def temperature(self):
        print("Getting value...")
        return self._temperature

    @temperature.setter
    def temperature(self, value):
        print("Setting value...")
        if value < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273 is not possible")
        self._temperature = value


# create an object
human = Celsius(37)

print(human.temperature)

print(human.to_fahrenheit())

coldest_thing = Celsius(-300)
Run Code
Output

Setting value...
Getting value...
37
Getting value...
98.60000000000001
Setting value...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 29, in 
  File "", line 4, in __init__
  File "", line 18, in temperature
ValueError: Temperature below -273 is not possible
The above implementation is simple and efficient. It is the recommended way to use property.










Python RegEx
In this tutorial, you will learn about regular expressions (RegEx), and use Python's re module to work with RegEx (with the help of examples).

A Regular Expression (RegEx) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. For example,

^a...s$
The above code defines a RegEx pattern. The pattern is: any five letter string starting with a and ending with s.

A pattern defined using RegEx can be used to match against a string.

Expression	String	Matched?
^a...s$	abs	No match
alias	Match
abyss	Match
Alias	No match
An abacus	No match
Python has a module named re to work with RegEx. Here's an example:

import re

pattern = '^a...s$'
test_string = 'abyss'
result = re.match(pattern, test_string)

if result:
  print("Search successful.")
else:
  print("Search unsuccessful.")	
Run Code
Here, we used re.match() function to search pattern within the test_string. The method returns a match object if the search is successful. If not, it returns None.

There are other several functions defined in the re module to work with RegEx. Before we explore that, let's learn about regular expressions themselves.

If you already know the basics of RegEx, jump to Python RegEx.

Specify Pattern Using RegEx
To specify regular expressions, metacharacters are used. In the above example, ^ and $ are metacharacters.

MetaCharacters
Metacharacters are characters that are interpreted in a special way by a RegEx engine. Here's a list of metacharacters:

[] . ^ $ * + ? {} () \ |

[] - Square brackets

Square brackets specifies a set of characters you wish to match.

Expression	String	Matched?
[abc]	a	1 match
ac	2 matches
Hey Jude	No match
abc de ca	5 matches
Here, [abc] will match if the string you are trying to match contains any of the a, b or c.

You can also specify a range of characters using - inside square brackets.

[a-e] is the same as [abcde].
[1-4] is the same as [1234].
[0-39] is the same as [01239].
You can complement (invert) the character set by using caret ^ symbol at the start of a square-bracket.

[^abc] means any character except a or b or c.
[^0-9] means any non-digit character.
. - Period

A period matches any single character (except newline '\n').

Expression	String	Matched?
..	a	No match
ac	1 match
acd	1 match
acde	2 matches (contains 4 characters)
^ - Caret

The caret symbol ^ is used to check if a string starts with a certain character.

Expression	String	Matched?
^a	a	1 match
abc	1 match
bac	No match
^ab	abc	1 match
acb	No match (starts with a but not followed by b)
$ - Dollar

The dollar symbol $ is used to check if a string ends with a certain character.

Expression	String	Matched?
a$	a	1 match
formula	1 match
cab	No match
* - Star

The star symbol * matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.

Expression	String	Matched?
ma*n	mn	1 match
man	1 match
maaan	1 match
main	No match (a is not followed by n)
woman	1 match
+ - Plus

The plus symbol + matches one or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.

Expression	String	Matched?
ma+n	mn	No match (no a character)
man	1 match
maaan	1 match
main	No match (a is not followed by n)
woman	1 match
? - Question Mark

The question mark symbol ? matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern left to it.

Expression	String	Matched?
ma?n	mn	1 match
man	1 match
maaan	No match (more than one a character)
main	No match (a is not followed by n)
woman	1 match
{} - Braces

Consider this code: {n,m}. This means at least n, and at most m repetitions of the pattern left to it.

Expression	String	Matched?
a{2,3}	abc dat	No match
abc daat	1 match (at daat)
aabc daaat	2 matches (at aabc and daaat)
aabc daaaat	2 matches (at aabc and daaaat)
Let's try one more example. This RegEx [0-9]{2, 4} matches at least 2 digits but not more than 4 digits

Expression	String	Matched?
[0-9]{2,4}	ab123csde	1 match (match at ab123csde)
12 and 345673	3 matches (12, 3456, 73)
1 and 2	No match
| - Alternation

Vertical bar | is used for alternation (or operator).

Expression	String	Matched?
a|b	cde	No match
ade	1 match (match at ade)
acdbea	3 matches (at acdbea)
Here, a|b match any string that contains either a or b

() - Group

Parentheses () is used to group sub-patterns. For example, (a|b|c)xz match any string that matches either a or b or c followed by xz

Expression	String	Matched?
(a|b|c)xz	ab xz	No match
abxz	1 match (match at abxz)
axz cabxz	2 matches (at axzbc cabxz)
\ - Backslash

Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. For example,

\$a match if a string contains $ followed by a. Here, $ is not interpreted by a RegEx engine in a special way.

If you are unsure if a character has special meaning or not, you can put \ in front of it. This makes sure the character is not treated in a special way.

Special Sequences

Special sequences make commonly used patterns easier to write. Here's a list of special sequences:

\A - Matches if the specified characters are at the start of a string.

Expression	String	Matched?
\Athe	the sun	Match
In the sun	No match
\b - Matches if the specified characters are at the beginning or end of a word.

Expression	String	Matched?
\bfoo	football	Match
a football	Match
afootball	No match
foo\b	the foo	Match
the afoo test	Match
the afootest	No match
\B - Opposite of \b. Matches if the specified characters are not at the beginning or end of a word.

Expression	String	Matched?
\Bfoo	football	No match
a football	No match
afootball	Match
foo\B	the foo	No match
the afoo test	No match
the afootest	Match
\d - Matches any decimal digit. Equivalent to [0-9]

Expression	String	Matched?
\d	12abc3	3 matches (at 12abc3)
Python	No match
\D - Matches any non-decimal digit. Equivalent to [^0-9]

Expression	String	Matched?
\D	1ab34"50	3 matches (at 1ab34"50)
1345	No match
\s - Matches where a string contains any whitespace character. Equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v].

Expression	String	Matched?
\s	Python RegEx	1 match
PythonRegEx	No match
\S - Matches where a string contains any non-whitespace character. Equivalent to [^ \t\n\r\f\v].

Expression	String	Matched?
\S	a b	2 matches (at  a b)
   	No match
\w - Matches any alphanumeric character (digits and alphabets). Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. By the way, underscore _ is also considered an alphanumeric character.

Expression	String	Matched?
\w	12&": ;c 	3 matches (at 12&": ;c)
%"> !	No match
\W - Matches any non-alphanumeric character. Equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]

Expression	String	Matched?
\W	1a2%c	1 match (at 1a2%c)
Python	No match
\Z - Matches if the specified characters are at the end of a string.

Expression	String	Matched?
Python\Z	I like Python	1 match
I like Python Programming	No match
Python is fun.	No match
Tip: To build and test regular expressions, you can use RegEx tester tools such as regex101. This tool not only helps you in creating regular expressions, but it also helps you learn it.

Now you understand the basics of RegEx, let's discuss how to use RegEx in your Python code.

Python RegEx
Python has a module named re to work with regular expressions. To use it, we need to import the module.

import re
The module defines several functions and constants to work with RegEx.

re.findall()
The re.findall() method returns a list of strings containing all matches.

Example 1: re.findall()

# Program to extract numbers from a string

import re

string = 'hello 12 hi 89. Howdy 34'
pattern = '\d+'

result = re.findall(pattern, string) 
print(result)

# Output: ['12', '89', '34']
If the pattern is not found, re.findall() returns an empty list.

re.split()
The re.split method splits the string where there is a match and returns a list of strings where the splits have occurred.

Example 2: re.split()

import re

string = 'Twelve:12 Eighty nine:89.'
pattern = '\d+'

result = re.split(pattern, string) 
print(result)

# Output: ['Twelve:', ' Eighty nine:', '.']
Run Code
If the pattern is not found, re.split() returns a list containing the original string.

You can pass maxsplit argument to the re.split() method. It's the maximum number of splits that will occur.


import re

string = 'Twelve:12 Eighty nine:89 Nine:9.'
pattern = '\d+'

# maxsplit = 1
# split only at the first occurrence
result = re.split(pattern, string, 1) 
print(result)

# Output: ['Twelve:', ' Eighty nine:89 Nine:9.']
Run Code
By the way, the default value of maxsplit is 0; meaning all possible splits.

re.sub()
The syntax of re.sub() is:

re.sub(pattern, replace, string)
The method returns a string where matched occurrences are replaced with the content of replace variable.

Example 3: re.sub()

# Program to remove all whitespaces
import re

# multiline string
string = 'abc 12\
de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
pattern = '\s+'

# empty string
replace = ''

new_string = re.sub(pattern, replace, string) 
print(new_string)

# Output: abc12de23f456
Run Code
If the pattern is not found, re.sub() returns the original string.

You can pass count as a fourth parameter to the re.sub() method. If omited, it results to 0. This will replace all occurrences.


import re

# multiline string
string = 'abc 12\
de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
pattern = '\s+'
replace = ''

new_string = re.sub(r'\s+', replace, string, 1) 
print(new_string)

# Output:
# abc12de 23
# f45 6
re.subn()
The re.subn() is similar to re.sub() except it returns a tuple of 2 items containing the new string and the number of substitutions made.

Example 4: re.subn()

# Program to remove all whitespaces
import re

# multiline string
string = 'abc 12\
de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
pattern = '\s+'

# empty string
replace = ''

new_string = re.subn(pattern, replace, string) 
print(new_string)

# Output: ('abc12de23f456', 4)
Run Code
re.search()
The re.search() method takes two arguments: a pattern and a string. The method looks for the first location where the RegEx pattern produces a match with the string.

If the search is successful, re.search() returns a match object; if not, it returns None.

match = re.search(pattern, str)
Example 5: re.search()

import re

string = "Python is fun"

# check if 'Python' is at the beginning
match = re.search('\APython', string)

if match:
  print("pattern found inside the string")
else:
  print("pattern not found")  

# Output: pattern found inside the string
Run Code
Here, match contains a match object.

Match object
You can get methods and attributes of a match object using dir() function.

Some of the commonly used methods and attributes of match objects are:

match.group()
The group() method returns the part of the string where there is a match.

Example 6: Match object

import re

string = '39801 356, 2102 1111'

# Three digit number followed by space followed by two digit number
pattern = '(\d{3}) (\d{2})'

# match variable contains a Match object.
match = re.search(pattern, string) 

if match:
  print(match.group())
else:
  print("pattern not found")

# Output: 801 35
Run Code
Here, match variable contains a match object.

Our pattern (\d{3}) (\d{2}) has two subgroups (\d{3}) and (\d{2}). You can get the part of the string of these parenthesized subgroups. Here's how:

>>> match.group(1)
'801'

>>> match.group(2)
'35'
>>> match.group(1, 2)
('801', '35')

>>> match.groups()
('801', '35')
match.start(), match.end() and match.span()
The start() function returns the index of the start of the matched substring. Similarly, end() returns the end index of the matched substring.

>>> match.start()
2
>>> match.end()
8
The span() function returns a tuple containing start and end index of the matched part.

>>> match.span()
(2, 8)
match.re and match.string
The re attribute of a matched object returns a regular expression object. Similarly, string attribute returns the passed string.

>>> match.re
re.compile('(\\d{3}) (\\d{2})')

>>> match.string
'39801 356, 2102 1111'
We have covered all commonly used methods defined in the re module. If you want to learn more, visit Python 3 re module.

Using r prefix before RegEx
When r or R prefix is used before a regular expression, it means raw string. For example, '\n' is a new line whereas r'\n' means two characters: a backslash \ followed by n.

Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. However, using r prefix makes \ treat as a normal character.

Example 7: Raw string using r prefix

import re

string = '\n and \r are escape sequences.'

result = re.findall(r'[\n\r]', string) 
print(result)

# Output: ['\n', '\r']
